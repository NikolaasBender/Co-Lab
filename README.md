These days, everyone seems glued to their social media,
So we asked:
What if we could bring that kind of engagement to the workplace?
And that's precisely what CoLab is.
We bring the engaging user experience of social media to project managementâ€™s doorstep, with engaging user functions like personalized pages and feeds, as well as a kanban project layout. CoLab brings the project to you, to keep you involved like never before.
