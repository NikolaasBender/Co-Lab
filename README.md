These days, everyone seems glued to their social media,
So we asked:
What if we could bring that kind of engagement to the workplace?
And that's precisely what CoLab is.
We bring the engaging user experience of social media to project managementâ€™s doorstep, with engaging user functions like personalized pages and feeds, as well as a kanban project layout. CoLab brings the project to you, to keep you involved like never before.

Build: To run our working app, visit the following URL: http://co-lab-237404.appspot.com.

When you have successfully logged in your personal userpage will open up, your photo in the corner following your name and bio underneath in the left column. In the right column will  be your timeline in which tasks will appear and organized accordingly:

The buttons aligned in a row at the top of the right column change what the column would show such as your tasks and things you have pinned from your feed:
